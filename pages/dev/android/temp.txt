[[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3635101/how-to-sign-android-app-with-system-signature]]


Build and flash to your Dream your own Android using http://source.android.com/documentation/building-for-dream. 
Use the mkkey.sh script on http://pdk.android.com/online-pdk/guide/release_keys.html to create new certificates, including x509 certificates before you do 'make'.

In the AndroidManifest.xml of your application: under the <manifest> element, add the attribute
  android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system".
Export an unsigned version of your Android application using Eclipse: right-click on the project >> Android Tools >> Export Unsigned Application Package.

Use <root-of-android-source-tree>/out/host/<your-host>/framework/signapk.jar to sign your app using platform.x509.pem and platform.pk8 in <root-of-android-source-tree>/build/target/product/security generated earlier:

  java -jar signapk.jar platform.x509.pem platform.pk8 YourApp-unsigned.apk YourApp-signed.apk.
  zipalign -fv 4 YourApplication-signed.apk YourApplication-aligned.apk

Install the app to your device:

    adb install YourApp-signed.apk

Run your app
    Use adb shell ps to confirm that your app is running as system.
